# cost-queries

Public, portable cost-attribution patterns derived from real investigations.
These are intentionally written as **CUR-style pseudo queries** (not company-specific).

## What’s in here
- **Instance / volume level cost attribution** (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Filters you almost always need (service, resource_id, charge type, time grain)
- Notes on how to join to “ownership” (tags, accounts, org metadata) when available

## Conventions
- `resource_id` = the unique identifier for the cloud resource (ex: EC2 instance id, EBS volume id)
- `net_amortized_cost` = preferred “true cost” signal when commitments exist (RI/SP)
- `unblended_cost` = useful fallback when amortized isn’t available
- Time grain: `1d` for investigations, `1w/1M` for reporting

## Files
- `ec2_instance_daily_cost.md` — daily cost for a single EC2 instance (resource-level)
- `ebs_unattached_volume_cost.md` — cost lookup pattern for an EBS volume
- `ownership_mapping_notes.md` — ways to map cost → owner/team (when tags/metadata exist)
